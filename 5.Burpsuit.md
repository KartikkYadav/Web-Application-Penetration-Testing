# Burp Suite

Burp Suite is a powerful integrated platform used primarily for web application penetration testing. It‚Äôs developed by PortSwigger and offers a range of tools to help security professionals identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications.

## What Is Burp Suite?

Burp Suite acts as an intercepting proxy that sits between your browser and the target web application. It allows you to:

- Inspect and modify HTTP(S) traffic on the fly
- Automate scans for common web vulnerabilities
- Manually test for complex security issues
- Reproduce and refine attacks like SQLi, XSS, CSRF, etc.

## Core Tools in Burp Suite

| Tool     | Functionality                                   |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Proxy    | Intercepts traffic between browser and server   |
| Intruder | Automates customized attacks (fuzzing, brute force, etc.) |
| Repeater | Manually modify and resend HTTP requests        |
| Scanner  | Automatically scans for security issues (Pro)   |
| Decoder  | Encodes/decodes and transforms data (Base64, URL, hex, etc.) |
| Comparer | Diffs between requests or responses             |
| Extender | Adds plugins or extensions (via BApp Store or custom code) |

## Typical Workflow

1. Set browser proxy to `127.0.0.1:8080`
2. Start Burp Suite and enable the proxy
3. Intercept requests from the browser (e.g., visiting `http://example.com`)
4. Use Repeater to modify and replay interesting requests
5. Use Intruder to automate payload testing
6. Review results and look for security issues

## HTTPS Interception

To intercept HTTPS:
- Install Burp‚Äôs CA certificate into your browser or system
- This allows Burp to decrypt and view HTTPS traffic without browser warnings

## Use Cases

- Testing login forms
- Discovering hidden parameters
- Exploiting IDOR, SSRF, and other logic flaws
- Performing fuzzing and brute-force attacks
- Auditing API endpoints

### Navigate to:

    chrome://settings/security

- Always use secure connections ‚ûî Turn OFF

### üîê How HTTPS Works

    HTTPS relies on [TLS (Transport Layer Security)] using asymmetric encryption:

**Key Type	Description**

- Private Key	Stored securely on the web server. Decrypts data encrypted with public key.

- Public Key	Shared with clients. Used to encrypt data sent to the server.

## üìÖ Installing Burp CA Certificate on Kali Linux

### **Step 1:** Intercept in Burp

- Open browser with Burp proxy enabled

      Visit: http://burp
      Click on "CA Certificate" to download cacert.der

### **Step 2:** Use curl With Proxy

    curl https://www.google.com --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080

### **Step 3:** Convert DER to CRT

     openssl x509 -in cacert.der -inform DER -out cacert.crt

### **Step 4:** Add to System Store

    cp -v cacert.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
    update-ca-certificates

### **Step 5:** Verify with curl

    curl https://www.google.com --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080 --cacert /path/to/cacert.crt

### **Step 6:** Using With Tools (e.g., dirsearch)

    dirsearch -u https://www.google.com --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080

### **Step 7:** Remove Certificate (Cleanup)

    rm -fv /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cacert.crt
    sudo update-ca-certificates --fresh
