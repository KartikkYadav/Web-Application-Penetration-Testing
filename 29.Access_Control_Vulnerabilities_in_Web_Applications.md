# Access Control Vulnerabilities in Web Applications

Access control in web applications ensures that users can only access resources and perform actions that match their assigned permissions. When access control is improperly implemented or broken, it can lead to serious security risks, including unauthorized data access and full system compromise.

---

## Broken Access Control

Broken access control occurs when restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced.

---

## Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

IDOR vulnerabilities arise when applications expose internal object references (such as account numbers or transaction IDs) and fail to verify whether the user is authorized to access them.

### Example
- An attacker modifies an account ID in the URL or request parameter  
- This allows access to another user's bank account details

---

## Privilege Escalation

Privilege escalation allows attackers to gain higher-level permissions than intended.

### Vertical Privilege Escalation
A low-privileged user gains access to high-privileged functionality.

**Example:**  
- A normal user gaining admin rights

### Horizontal Privilege Escalation
A user accesses or modifies another user's data at the same privilege level.

**Example:**  
- Viewing or editing another customer's profile

## Comparison: Broken Access Control vs. Privilege Escalation

| Aspect | Broken Access Control | Privilege Escalation |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Nature | Vulnerability category | Attack technique / outcome |
| Scope | Broad | Narrow |
| Root Cause | Missing or flawed authorization checks | Broken access control |
| Can Occur Without Authentication? | Yes (in some cases) | No |
| Requires User Account? | Not always | Yes |
| Includes IDOR? | Yes | Yes (horizontal privilege escalation) |
| Affects Authorization Layer? | Yes | Yes |
| Typical Impact | Unauthorized access to data or functionality | Full or partial takeover of higher-privileged functions |
| Common Attack Methods | IDOR, forced browsing, parameter tampering | Role manipulation, access to admin endpoints |
| Detection During Testing | Authorization bypass checks | Role-based access testing |
| Ease of Exploitation | Often easy | Medium to high (depends on access control weakness) |
| OWASP Category | A01: Broken Access Control | Subset of A01: Broken Access Control |

## Missing Function-Level Access Control

This vulnerability occurs when access to sensitive functions is not properly restricted on the server side.

### Key Issues
- Administrative functions are accessible without proper authorization checks  
- Attackers discover hidden functionality by guessing URLs or inspecting requests  

### Example

    /admin/dashboard

## Forced Browsing

Forced browsing involves manually guessing or enumerating URLs to access restricted resources.

### Example
- An application contains an admin page `/admin`
- Access control is not enforced
- Any user can type the URL and gain access

---

## Parameter Tampering

Attackers manipulate request parameters to bypass access control.

### Examples
- Changing `role=user` to `role=admin`
- Modifying account or transaction identifiers

---

## Client-Side Access Control

Access control enforced only via JavaScript or UI logic.

---

## Business Logic Vulnerabilities

Business logic defines how an application operates and enforces workflows. Flaws in business logic can lead to severe consequences such as financial fraud or unauthorized access.

### Impact
- Unauthorized actions  
- Abuse of workflows  
- Financial loss or data exposure  

---

## Failure to Enforce Business Logic Access Control

Occurs when the application fails to enforce authorization checks aligned with business rules.

### Examples
- Users applying discounts they are not eligible for  
- Skipping approval steps in workflows  
- Accessing sensitive data by bypassing intended processes  

---

## Summary

Broken access control remains one of the most critical web application security risks. Proper server-side authorization checks, secure design of business logic, and regular security testing are essential to prevent these vulnerabilities.
