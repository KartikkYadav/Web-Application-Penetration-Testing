# 🍪 PHP Cookie Superglobal Variable (`$_COOKIE`)

## 🔹 What is `$_COOKIE`?

`$_COOKIE` is a PHP superglobal array that stores cookie values sent by the browser.

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client-side and sent with every HTTP request to the server. You can use cookies to save user preferences, login info, or session identifiers.

---

## ✅ Practical Example: Setting and Reading Cookies

### 1. Set a Cookie (`set_cookie.php`)

    <?php
     // Set a cookie named "user" with value "JohnDoe" that expires in 1 hour
     setcookie("user", "JohnDoe", time() + 3600, "/");

     // Inform the user
     echo "Cookie 'user' is set. Refresh the page to see the cookie value.";
    ?>

### 2. Read a Cookie (read_cookie.php)

    <?php
        if (isset($_COOKIE['user'])) {
        echo "Welcome back, " . htmlspecialchars($_COOKIE['user']) . "!";
      } else {
       echo "Cookie 'user' is not set.";
      }
    ?>

## 📘 Notes on `$_COOKIE`

| $_COOKIE` | Associative array of cookie names and values sent by the browser |

- Cookies **must be set before any HTML output** (i.e., before any `echo` or HTML tags).
- Cookie values should be **sanitized before output** to avoid security risks.
- Cookies have **expiration time, path, domain, and security flags** that can be set with `setcookie()`.
