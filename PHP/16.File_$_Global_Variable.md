# 📂 PHP File Upload Global Variable (`$_FILES`)

## 🔹 What is `$_FILES`?

`$_FILES` is a PHP **superglobal** that is used to handle file uploads via HTML forms.

When a user uploads a file, the form data is sent using the `multipart/form-data` encoding type. PHP automatically populates the `$_FILES` array with information about the uploaded file.

## ✅ Practical File Upload Example

### 📁 1. HTML Form (`upload_form.html`)


    <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
        <head>
          <title>File Upload</title>
        </head>
         <body>
             <h2>Upload a File</h2>
               <form action="upload_handler.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
               Select file: <input type="file" name="uploaded_file">
             <br><br>
           <input type="submit" value="Upload">
         </form> 
       </body>
      </html>

📝 2. PHP Handler (upload_handler.php)

     <?php
        if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
         if (isset($_FILES['uploaded_file']) && $_FILES['uploaded_file']['error'] === UPLOAD_ERR_OK) {
        
          $fileTmpPath = $_FILES['uploaded_file']['tmp_name'];
          $fileName = $_FILES['uploaded_file']['name'];
          $fileSize = $_FILES['uploaded_file']['size'];
          $fileType = $_FILES['uploaded_file']['type'];

          $uploadDir = 'uploads/';
          $destination = $uploadDir . basename($fileName);

          // Create upload directory if it doesn't exist
          if (!is_dir($uploadDir)) {
            mkdir($uploadDir, 0777, true);
          }

          if (move_uploaded_file($fileTmpPath, $destination)) {
             echo "✅ File uploaded successfully!<br>";
             echo "📄 File name: $fileName <br>";
             echo "📦 File type: $fileType <br>";
             echo "📏 File size: " . round($fileSize / 1024, 2) . " KB";
          } else {
              echo "❌ Failed to move uploaded file.";
          }

       } else {
            echo "❌ No file uploaded or upload error.";
       }
      }
    ?>
