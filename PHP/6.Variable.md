In PHP, variables are used to store data such as numbers, strings, arrays, and objects. Here’s a simple guide to understanding PHP variables:

🔹 Basic Syntax
   A variable starts with a dollar sign ($) followed by the variable name.

   Variable names are case-sensitive ($name and $Name are different).

   Must start with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores.


    $name = "John";      // String
    $age = 30;           // Integer
    $isAdmin = true;     // Boolean

🔹 Rules for Naming Variables
   
   ✅ Valid:
        
        $first_name = "Alice";
        $_count = 10;
        $number2 = 20;

   ❌ Invalid:

        $2number = 20;    // Cannot start with a number
        $my-name = "Sam"; // Hyphen is not allowed
🔹 Variable Types with Example

    $city = "New York";         // String
    $temperature = 28.5;        // Float
    $isRaining = false;         // Boolean
    $population = 8000000;      // Integer
