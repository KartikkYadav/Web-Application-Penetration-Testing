Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.

1. while Loop
 
 Executes the block as long as the condition is true.

    <?php
    $i = 1;
    while ($i <= 5) {
     echo "Number: $i <br>";
     $i++;
    }
    ?>

2. do...while Loop
 
 Similar to while, but ensures the loop runs at least once.

    <?php
    $i = 1;
    do {
    echo "Number: $i <br>";
    $i++;
    } while ($i <= 5);
    ?>

3. for Loop
 
 Used when the number of iterations is known.

    <?php
    for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
    echo "Number: $i <br>";
    }
    ?>

4. foreach Loop
 
 Used to iterate over arrays.

    <?php
    $colors = array("Red", "Green", "Blue");
    foreach ($colors as $color) {
    echo "Color: $color <br>";
    }
    ?>

ðŸ”„ Loop Control Statements
 
 break: Exit the loop.

 continue: Skip current iteration and continue with next.

Example with break:

    <?php
    for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    if ($i == 6) {
        break;
    }
    echo "$i <br>";
    }
    ?>

Example with continue:

    <?php
    for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
    if ($i == 3) {
        continue;
    }
    echo "$i <br>";
    }
    ?>
