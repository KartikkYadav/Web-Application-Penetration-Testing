# 🌍 Global Variables and 🌐 Server Global Variables in PHP

This documentation explains the usage of two important PHP superglobal arrays: `$_REQUEST` and `$_SERVER`. Examples and notes are included to help you understand how they work.

---

## 📌 Request Global Variables (`$_REQUEST`)

### 🔹 What is `$_REQUEST`?

$_REQUEST` is a PHP superglobal array that contains data from:

- `$_GET`
- `$_POST`
- `$_COOKIE`

It is used to collect form data sent with either the `GET` or `POST` method.

---

### ✅ Example

**HTML Form (`index.html`):**


     <form method="post" action="process.php">
         Name: <input type="text" name="username">
     <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>

PHP Script (process.php):


    <?php

    // Handle the form submission

    echo "Welcome, " . $_REQUEST['username'];

    ?>

📘 Notes

  = Use $_REQUEST when you want to handle form data regardless of request method.

  = Prefer $_GET or $_POST if you need more control over how data is submitted.

  = The order of data in $_REQUEST depends on the variables_order setting in php.ini.

  ## 🌐 Server Global Variables (`$_SERVER`)

### 🔹 What is `$_SERVER`?

`$_SERVER` is a PHP superglobal array that contains important information about:

- The server environment  
- Request method  
- Script location  
- Client details  

---

### ✅ Example

**PHP Script Example (`server-info.php`):**


    <?php
       echo "Current Script:  " . $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] . "<br>";
       echo "Server Name: "  . $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] . "<br>";
       echo "Request Method: "  . $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] . "<br>";
       echo "User Agent: "  . $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] . "<br>";
       echo "Client IP Address: "  . $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] . "<br>";
    ?>

## 📘 Notes

| Key               | Description                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `PHP_SELF`        | The filename of the currently executing script            |
| `SERVER_NAME`     | The server host name (e.g., `localhost`)                  |
| `REQUEST_METHOD`  | The HTTP method used for the request (`GET`, `POST`)      |
| `HTTP_USER_AGENT` | The client’s browser and operating system                 |
| `REMOTE_ADDR`     | The IP address of the user accessing the page             |

These variables are useful for:

- ✅ Debugging  
- ✅ Logging  
- ✅ Building environment-aware web applications

> ⚠️ **Note:** Values may vary depending on the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
