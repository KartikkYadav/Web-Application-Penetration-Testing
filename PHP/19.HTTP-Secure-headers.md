# HTTP Secure Headers

HTTP Secure Headers are additional HTTP response headers that web servers can send to instruct browsers on how to behave when handling website content. They enhance security by mitigating common vulnerabilities.

## üîê Common Secure Headers

### 1. Content-Security-Policy (CSP)

**Purpose:** Prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

**How it works:**  
CSP allows the server to whitelist trusted sources for scripts, styles, images, fonts, frames, and more. If the browser detects resources loaded from unauthorized sources, it blocks them, mitigating attacks that rely on injecting malicious content.

**Example:**

    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' cdn.example.com


## 2. Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
**Purpose:** Enforces secure (HTTPS) connections to the server.


**How it works:**
When a browser receives this header, it remembers to only use HTTPS for the site (and optionally its subdomains) for a specified period (max-age). This protects users against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking.

**Example:**

    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload

### 3. X-Content-Type-Options

**Purpose:** Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content-type.

**How it works:**
Browsers sometimes try to guess the MIME type of a resource, which can lead to security issues if the sniffed type is interpreted incorrectly (e.g., executing scripts in a non-script file). Setting this header to nosniff forces the browser to respect the declared content type.

**Example:**

    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

### 4. X-Frame-Options

**Purpose:** Protects against clickjacking by controlling whether the site can be framed.

**How it works:**
By specifying this header, the site can prevent other domains from embedding its pages, avoiding UI redress attacks.

**Example:**

    X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

    
### 5. X-XSS-Protection (Deprecated in modern browsers)

**Purpose:** Enables the cross-site scripting (XSS) filter built into most browsers.

**Note:**
Most modern browsers have deprecated this header in favor of Content-Security-Policy, which is more robust.

**Example:**

    X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
### 6. Referrer-Policy
**Purpose:** Controls how much referrer information is included with requests.

**How it works:**
Restricts or allows the browser to include the referrer header based on the security context and privacy considerations.

**Example:**

    Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade

### 7. Permissions-Policy (formerly Feature-Policy)
**Purpose:** Controls access to browser features like camera, microphone, and geolocation.

**How it works:**
Allows sites to specify which features can be used or blocked by the page or embedded frames, enhancing privacy and security.

**Example:**

    Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()

### 8. Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP)
**Purpose:** Protects against leaking sensitive data across origins.

**How it works:**
Specifies which origins can load the resource, helping mitigate cross-origin attacks.

**Example:**

    Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
