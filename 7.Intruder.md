# Intruder

### [🔗 Intruder](#)
The **Intruder tool in Burp Suite** is a powerful feature used for **automated testing of web application inputs**. It allows you to **send multiple payloads** to one or more positions in a request to perform tasks like:

- Brute-forcing logins  
- Enumerating user accounts  
- Testing for SQL injection, XSS, and other injection flaws  
- Discovering hidden parameters or directories

## 🛠️ Intruder Tool - Overview

### 🔑 Use Case
The Intruder tool is used to **automate customized payload attacks** against specific request fields (e.g., cookies, POST data, URL params, headers).

---

## 📋 How It Works

1. **Capture a request** using Burp’s Proxy.
2. **Send it to Intruder**: Right-click the request → *"Send to Intruder"*.
3. **Configure attack positions**:
   - Highlight the parts of the request you want to target.  
   - Burp will wrap them with `$` symbols (e.g., `username=$admin$`)
4. **Set the attack type**:
   - **Sniper** – One payload at a time, one position.  
   - **Battering Ram** – Same payload in all positions.  
   - **Pitchfork** – Multiple payload sets, synchronized across positions.  
   - **Cluster Bomb** – Multiple payload sets, all combinations.

## 🎯 Attack Types Explained

| **Type**         | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sniper**       | Good for single-parameter testing like XSS/SQLi.                                |
| **Battering Ram**| Sends same payload to multiple positions. Useful for repeated auth headers, tokens. |
| **Pitchfork**    | Sends one value from each list to each position. Useful for multi-field forms.  |
| **Cluster Bomb** | Tries all combinations of payloads across positions. Best for multi-step brute-force. |

## 🔓 Example: Brute-force Login

1. Intercept login request and send to Intruder.  
2. Set username and password fields as positions.  
3. Choose **Cluster Bomb** attack type.  
4. Load a **user list** and a **password list** as payloads.  
5. Start attack and analyze **HTTP status codes, lengths, or response messages** to detect valid logins.

---

## 💡 Payload Options

You can use:

- **Custom wordlists** (like rockyou.txt)  
- **Numbers, dates, brute-force sequences**  
- **Character fuzzing**  
- **Pre-built payload types** (e.g., SQLi, XSS payloads)  
- **Burp Extensions** (for advanced payloads)

---

## 📊 Response Analysis

Look at the **response length**, **status code**, or **response content** to identify successful or interesting responses.

Use **columns** like:

- `Status`  
- `Length`  
- `Words`  
- `Lines`  
- `Custom Grep`

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- **Intruder is rate-limited** in the free/community version.  
- For **high-speed attacks**, use **Burp Suite Professional**.  
- Combine with **Grep Extract** or **Match and Replace** to extract tokens or modify request parts dynamically.
