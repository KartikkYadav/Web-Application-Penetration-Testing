Weak or misconfigured encryption exposes sensitive data such as passwords, credit cards, or PII.

**Examples:**
- Using HTTP instead of HTTPS  
- Insecure key storage  
- Weak hashing (e.g., MD5)  

> *Emphasizes cryptographic issues, not just data exposure.*

---

### 🔹 A03:2021 – Injection

**Description:**  
Still a critical issue where attackers send malicious input to interpreters (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, LDAP).

**Examples:**
- SQL Injection
