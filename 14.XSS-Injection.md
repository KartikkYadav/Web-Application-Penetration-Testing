# Cross-Site-Scripting(XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is still a critical web security risk that involves attackers injecting malicious scripts into otherwise trustworthy sites, causing others’ browsers to execute the attacker’s code. The ramifications range from credential theft to possible full system compromise.

## How XSS Works

- Occurs when untrusted data (often user input) is inserted into web pages without validation and sanitization.

- Most commonly uses JavaScript, but can exploit any language the browser supports.

- The attacker’s script runs whenever another user views the crafted page or link, under the context of the vulnerable site.

#### Types of XSS Attacks

- Reflected XSS: The payload is reflected off the web server (usually via a parameter in the URL).

- Stored (Persistent) XSS: The payload is saved (for instance, in a database) and rendered repeatedly to victims.

- DOM-based XSS: The vulnerability is present in the client-side code, where the DOM is manipulated insecurely, and may not involve sending malicious code to the server.

### Risks and Impact

- Stealing authentication cookies, session tokens, or sensitive data.

- Impersonating users, keylogging, phishing, or installing malware.

- Modifying site content (defacement) or redirecting users to malicious sites.

- XSS prevalence has grown due to the increased use of dynamic, JavaScript-heavy applications.

- In worst cases, especially where admin accounts are compromised, this can lead to full application or system takeover.

### Prevention

- Sanitize and Encode Inputs: Always treat user input as untrusted. Encode data based on context (HTML, JS, attribute, URL, etc.).

- Use Secure Frameworks/Libraries: Opt for frameworks that help manage output encoding and automatically mitigate XSS.

- Content Security Policy (CSP): Enforce strong CSPs to block inline and unauthorized scripts:


      Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-src 'none'; base-uri 'none';

- Test and Review: Frequent code reviews and vulnerability scanning (tools like Burp Suite, ZAP, etc.).

- Keep Dependencies Updated: Many 2025 XSS incidents stem from outdated third-party components—patch regularly.
