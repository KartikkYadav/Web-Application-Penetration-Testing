# 📌 ALTER TABLE in MySQL

## ✅ What is ALTER TABLE?
- Used to modify the structure of an existing table.
- You can add, delete, rename columns, change data types, or rename the table itself.

### 🔹 Examples

- ➕ **Add a column**

      ALTER TABLE student1
      ADD enable INT(1);

### ✏️ Modify a column (e.g., make NOT NULL)

     ALTER TABLE student1
     MODIFY enable INT(1) NOT NULL;

- ➡️ Modify column position
 
      ALTER TABLE student1
      MODIFY enable INT(1) NOT NULL AFTER email;

- 📝 Rename a column

      ALTER TABLE student1
      CHANGE id ID INT(10) NOT NULL;
      ALTER TABLE student1
      CHANGE name Full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL;

- 🗑️ Drop a column

      ALTER TABLE student1
      DROP COLUMN enable;

- 🔄 Rename the table

      ALTER TABLE student1
      RENAME TO student2;

### 📌 SQL JOINERS

- ✅ What are SQL JOINs?

   Used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

   This allows pulling related data spread across multiple tables.

🔹 INNER JOIN

     SELECT * FROM table1 
     INNER JOIN table2 
     ON table1.id = table2.id;

🔹 LEFT JOIN

    SELECT * FROM table1 
    LEFT JOIN table2 
    ON table1.id = table2.id;

🔹 RIGHT JOIN

    SELECT * FROM table1 
    RIGHT JOIN table2 
    ON table1.id = table2.id;

🔹 FULL OUTER JOIN

    SELECT * FROM table1 
    FULL OUTER JOIN table2 
    ON table1.id = table2.id;

🔹 CROSS JOIN

    SELECT * FROM table1 
    CROSS JOIN table2;

🔹 SELF JOIN

    SELECT * FROM table t1
    INNER JOIN table t2 
    ON t1.parent_id = t2.id;

### 📌 GROUP BY Clause

- ✅ What is GROUP BY?

  Used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, like totals or counts.

  Common with aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc).

🔹 Examples

- ➡️ Basic grouping

      SELECT course_name 
      FROM users 
      GROUP BY course_name;

- ➡️ Count occurrences

      SELECT course_name, COUNT(course_name)
      FROM users
      GROUP BY course_name;

- ➡️ With condition

      SELECT course_name, COUNT(course_name)
      FROM users
      WHERE id < 15
      GROUP BY course_name;

- ➡️ Group by gender

      SELECT gender, COUNT(gender)
      FROM users
      GROUP BY gender;

- ➡️ Group by city with condition

       SELECT city_name, COUNT(city_name)
       FROM users
       WHERE gender = 'F'
       GROUP BY city_name;
