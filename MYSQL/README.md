MySQL is a fast, reliable, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) developed and maintained by Oracle Corporation. It is based on Structured Query Language (SQL), which is the standard language for accessing and managing data in relational databases.

MySQL is widely used in web development, often as part of the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl). It supports large-scale, data-intensive applications and is known for its performance, scalability, and ease of use.
